The problem being solved by these projects was creating and sorting course information for the Computer Science Department at a mock college, named ABCU.
In my approach I decided to use a hash table as a data structure to store the data that is imported from the provided file.
One roadblock I faced, and overcame, in this project was the implementation of printing all courses alphanumerically. Specifically, my program would print
only the first course from the hash table. I found the issue to be related to looping through the hash table. After adding a while loop to iterate through each bucket,
the program functioned as it should. Working on these projects has expanded my approach to programming through furthering my understanding of data types. 
They helped evolve the way I write programs by giving me further insight into class and structure creation used to manipulate data types and process data.
