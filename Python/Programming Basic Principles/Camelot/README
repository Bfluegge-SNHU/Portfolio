Camelot is a fun project that will be converted into a fully fleshed out pygame title (The name is guaranteed to change).
This is a proof of concept for the character creation portion of the game. Barbarian class selection displays stat block concepts
and Ranger class selection displays focus selection options and functionality. This game may continue as text based until the pygame rework
is up and running. Thanks for checking it out!
