For this project I was tasked with crafting a software design document for The Gaming Room, a fictitious client who hosts
an Android gaming app by the name of Draw it or Lose it. The client wished to expand their horizons by developing a web application
that can be played on multiple platforms. In developing this document I'd like to highlight the UML diagram that 
maps the project for development. The diagram is well formulated and utilizes a singleton pattern to ensure only one game instance
is created at a time. In working through the design document insight was provided on how to implement the code. Clear and concise decisions allowed
me to optimize decisions in my coding in order to provide the best software for the client. One part of the document I would revise is the development
tools portion of the evaluation. The bullet points highlighted effectively define tools that may be utilized for the project, but do not specify any 
exact tools to be used.

User experience is important when designing software, especially when creating a gaming application. In keeping the user in mind, I made recommendations 
that prioritize the user's experience. These include using Linux as a server operating platform, utilizing SSD storage technology for smooth server storage,
and utilizing restful APIs for connectivity. In designing the software I used the UML diagram to maintain organization in my code. I also used common design
patterns to create clean, reusable code.
