	For this project I was tasked to create an interest return projection application for a financial institution. The application takes the initial investment amount, a monthly deposit amount, the number of years for the investment, and the annual interest rate from the user. This is then calculated and formatted into an easy to read table highlighting the interest returns over the given number of years.
	In this project I demonstrated great use of separate modules for specific tasks. Maintaining minimum usage of the main function. A good example of this is the PrintFormat module that provides abstraction and encapsulation to the code. Looking at the same module, I believe I could have enhanced this code by separating the math required for the program from the print formatting module. This improvement would help with readability and debugging.
	The most challenging portion of this project was getting the for loops to behave correctly whilst performing the math for projections using monthly deposits. Breaking down the exact execution line by line assisted me in deciphering exactly what information should be housed within the loops and what information needed to be excluded. Also, the provided material in my CS-210 course assisted in the formatting of the text output.
	A skill that will be transferrable to future projects and courses is the algorithmic fashion of determining the annual interest from monthly compound interest amounts. Essentially, in basic form, breaking the annual interest into monthly compound interest to find accurate totals to output for monthly deposit amounts was algorithmic in nature. This program is maintainable, readable, and adaptable through the use of in-line comments, proper whitespace usage, and clear and concise titling of each class.
